    <p>Adidas, founded in 1949 by Adolf “Adi” Dassler in Herzogenaurach, Germany, has grown into one of the world’s most
      iconic sportswear brands. Its origin story is rooted in a sibling rivalry—Adi split from his brother Rudolf, who
      went on to create Puma, sparking a legendary feud that shaped the sneaker industry. Adidas quickly distinguished
      itself with its trademark three stripes, a design element so powerful it became synonymous with the brand’s
      identity. Originally purchased from a Finnish company for a modest sum and two bottles of whiskey, the stripes
      evolved into a global symbol of athletic excellence and streetwear cool. Over the decades, Adidas has blended
      performance innovation with cultural relevance, producing legendary shoes like the Superstar, Stan Smith, and
      Samba. These models not only dominated sports arenas but also became staples in hip-hop, skateboarding, and
      fashion scenes. The brand’s collaborations with artists like Kanye West (Yeezy), Pharrell Williams, and Beyoncé
      have pushed boundaries, merging sport with style and redefining sneaker culture. Adidas also maintains deep roots
      in football, owning a stake in Bayern Munich and sponsoring elite clubs and athletes worldwide. Financially, it
      remains a powerhouse, generating over €23 billion in annual revenue and employing more than 60,000 people
      globally. Beyond products, Adidas champions sustainability, investing in recycled materials and eco-conscious
      manufacturing. Its “Impossible Is Nothing” slogan reflects a commitment to innovation, inclusivity, and pushing
      limits—whether on the pitch or in the streets. From Olympic podiums to fashion runways, Adidas continues to shape
      how the world moves, dresses, and expresses itself. For sneakerheads like you, kaka, it’s more than just a
      brand—it’s a legacy stitched into every sole, every stripe, and every story. Whether you're building your own
      sneaker site or rocking a pair of Superstars, Adidas is always part of the conversation.</p>
